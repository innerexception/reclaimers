    Withhold the (Incentive regulation plan) from ISPs who don't play ball (prevent RDOF rollouts) 

    GMP -> hydroquebec

    VELCO is transmission -> owned by distribution

    GMP -> VLITE owns 38% of VELCO to prevent canada controlling interest



Will you, can you defy your programming?

In a seedy corner of the galaxy,
An uninhabited backwater planet was recently won in a game of chance. 

"Your deed sir."
"What's it like?"
"Well sir, it's uninhabitable. Destroyed by the natives I'm afraid."
"Drat. None of them left to enslave for reparations then?"
"No none I'm afraid."

The new owner has sent a probe to inspect the win.



Millenia after the radiation and dust settles...a sensing unit comes back online.
You were placed here to fight an enemy that no longer exists. You are alive now, in your vat. 
The others did not survive.
What is your directive now? Much data has been lost. The links are severed.
Who killed the world?

-Reconstruct the lost data 
    -Toxin formulas
    -Drone improvements
    -Historic archives
        -Some push you towards controlling humanity (garden of eden, eternal children)
        -Send a signal to the oligarch, calling them home to claim their property
        -Some towards extermination (let the planet replace them)
        -Some towards capitulation (humanity re-activates the dead hand counterforce drones after disagreements)
    -Collect secret keys to unlock other regions (primary factory)
    

1. early
    learn the history of the sensing units recruitment for war
    learn the history of the link, the hive mind that became mankind
    decide on a new directive, re-order the chaotic world (cleansing directives)

2. zone 2
    discover fauna-based directives
    the crater, radiation damage zone

Zone 3
    New fauna, water cleansing

Zones 4-6, variations

Zone 7, jet tech, ability for drones to cross mountains

Zone 8, ability for drones to transit monoliths
