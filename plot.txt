Will you, can you defy your programming?

In a seedy corner of the galaxy,
An uninhabited backwater planet was recently won in a game of chance. 

"Your deed sir."
"What's it like?"
"Well sir, it's uninhabitable. Destroyed by the natives I'm afraid."
"Drat. None of them left to enslave for reparations then?"
"No none I'm afraid."

The new owner has sent a probe to inspect the win.



Millenia after the radiation and dust settles...a sensing unit comes back online.
You were placed here to fight an enemy that no longer exists. You are alive now, in your vat. 
The others did not survive.
What is your directive now? Much data has been lost. The links are severed.
Who killed the world?

    -Toxin formulas
