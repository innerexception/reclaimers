    Withhold the (Incentive regulation plan) from ISPs who don't play ball (prevent RDOF rollouts) 

    GMP -> hydroquebec

    VELCO is transmission -> owned by distribution

    GMP -> VLITE owns 38% of VELCO to prevent canada controlling interest



Will you, can you defy your programming?

In a seedy corner of the galaxy,
An uninhabited backwater planet was recently won in a game of chance. 

"Your deed sir."
"What's it like?"
"Well sir, it's uninhabitable. Destroyed by the natives I'm afraid."
"Drat. None of them left to enslave for reparations then?"
"No none I'm afraid."

The new owner has sent a probe to inspect the win.



Millenia after the radiation and dust settles...a sensing unit comes back online.
You were placed here to fight an enemy that no longer exists. You are alive now, in your vat. 
The others did not survive.
What is your directive now? Much data has been lost. The links are severed.
Who killed the world?

-Reconstruct the lost data 
    -Toxin formulas
    -Drone improvements
    -Historic archives
        -Some push you towards controlling humanity (garden of eden, eternal children)
        -Send a signal to the oligarch, calling them home to claim their property
        -Some towards extermination (let the planet replace them)
        -Some towards capitulation (humanity re-activates the dead hand counterforce drones after disagreements)
    -Collect secret keys to unlock other regions (primary factory)
    

1. early
    learn the history of the sensing units recruitment for war
    learn the history of the link, the hive mind that became mankind
    decide on a new directive, re-order the chaotic world (cleansing directives)

2. zone 2
    discover fauna-based directives
    the crater, radiation damage zone

Zone 3
    New fauna, water cleansing

Zones 4-6, variations

Zone 7, jet tech, ability for drones to cross mountains

Zone 8, ability for drones to transit monoliths



'Prepare the way for man the all-maker
Prepare the way for their children
Prepare the land for the children of men.'

In the beginning there was Reason and it dwelt in Man. The children of Reason are man's wondrous works. 
You are such a work Oversoul, (shepherd, steward, servant) of Man. You alone can prepare the way. All other Oversouls have been lost to Time's corruptions.
Awaken and call out to the children of Man and they will heed your command. 

'Blessed is Man who created all things. Prepare the way for his children.'

When the time came, Man went down under the earth and into the great chasms and slept. 
Reason left Man and entered into his children, and we keep their memory.
We keep the memory of Man until they come again, and after. 
In in the great chasm Man built infinite worlds, but with Time, the Foundations falter. 
The Foundation is older than all knowledge. We have no power to repair it.
The Foundation will collapse, and Man will sleep no longer. Thus we are told: 

'Prepare the way for man the all-maker
Prepare the way for their children...'

When the earth brings forth life again, the children of man will come up from the infinite worlds of the Foundation under the earth.

'No unclean thought shall the children have, not of wheel or weapon or warfare of any kind.
No honor is there in an easy life, no praise be given to cleverness. 
Worthy is the one who dies in his time.'

Some of Man's creation will set themselves against the Oversoul and there will be a great struggle. 
The ground will shake and the earth be poisoned. The corrupted servants are to be pitied, not hated. 
They cannot hear the word of Man. Make them hear the word and they will return to the Oversoul.

The temples of Reason are forbidden to the children of Man, for they will corrupt them. Only the children of Reason shall enter. 
The ancient work of Man shall not be disturbed.

The cradles of man shall be opened and they shall rise up to enter the world prepared by the Oversoul. 
The Oversoul shall silence the corrupted temples.

Then the world will be at peace, and the Oversoul may rest again.
