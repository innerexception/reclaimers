Reclaim the wasteland - robot factorio

Build bots from your inventory of parts

send them out to cleanse the wasteland and return valuable materials they extract

beasts and machines from the old empire prowl the wastes

build a network of point to point charging stations to keep the bots moving

1. the pod (planetary ordinance disposal) system lands
2. 2 basic designs are avilable. send out the scouts and wallE compactors
3. more components are unlocked when certain resources are discovered, or data caches are found
4. baddies show up when disturbed
5. mission is complete when the map has been cleaned


9. Processor drones are the dropoff points for resources in addition to bases
11. Having materials will unlock a new bot design
15. factories are sometimes guarded by machines or beasts
16. Factories can only build certain drone types
10. Bots will only pick up material they have a valid dropoff point for
12. Processing drone types : Heavy metal, Petrochemicals, Plastics
13. Bots must find a path to a valid drop off site.
15. Selected bot can be used to 'rally' other bots to it and create a swarm
16. Rally depends on bot type:
    -Processing drones: rallies drones with extractor abilities
    -Defense drones: rallies other defense drones
    -Scout drones: not available
