Reclaim the wasteland - robot factorio

Build bots from your inventory of parts

send them out to cleanse the wasteland and return valuable materials they extract

beasts and machines from the old empire prowl the wastes

build a network of point to point charging stations to keep the bots moving


-bot parts
    -Chassis
    -Cargo space
    -Weapon hard point
    -Toxin extractor
        -Lead
        -Isotopes

1. the pod (planetary ordinance disposal) system lands
2. 2 basic designs are avilable. send out the scouts and wallE compactors
3. more components are unlocked when certain resources are discovered, or data caches are found
4. baddies show up when disturbed
5. mission is complete when the map has been cleaned
15. Selected bot can be used to 'rally' other bots to it and create a swarm
16. Rally depends on bot type:
    -Processing drones: rallies drones with extractor abilities
    -Defense drones: rallies other defense drones
    -Scout drones: not available

2. Finish objective chains & triggers
1. Final objective: disassemble all structures and drones, leaving only nature behind.

11. Apply tech research to existing units not just new ones
12. Generate human villages over time (If wake the all-makers is chosen)
3. Design more region maps tied to objective chains
1. Implement ord regeneration ability

16. inactive factories are guarded by fixed groups of creatures
15. villages and caves sometimes produce enemy creatures (creature probability table is tile based)
11. If swarm leader is selected, draw lines to swarm members?
