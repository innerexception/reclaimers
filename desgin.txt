Reclaim the wasteland - robot factorio

Build bots from your inventory of parts

send them out to cleanse the wasteland and return valuable materials they extract

beasts and machines from the old empire prowl the wastes

build a network of point to point charging stations to keep the bots moving


-bot parts
    -Chassis
    -Cargo space
    -Weapon hard point
    -Toxin extractor
        -Lead
        -Isotopes
        -Mercury
        -Petrochemicals
        -Biosludge
    -Battery
    -Drive system
    -Sensor suite

1. the pod (planetary ordinance disposal) system lands
2. 2 basic designs are avilable. send out the scouts and wallE compactors
3. more components are unlocked when certain resources are discovered, or data caches are found
4. baddies show up when disturbed
15. Selected bot can be used to 'rally' other bots to it and create a swarm
16. Rally depends on bot type:
    -Defense drones: rallies other defense drones

7. 7 regions with 7 drone types (each region has a signature type plus 1 or more other types of drone). 
   Convert the factories to stop the drone/monster waves.
   The solution to each Type of drone is found in a Lab somewhere in the world.
   Each type has a different effect on the humans the region, described in the intro text of the region.
    -Type 1: Requires blue (pacifier) laser to defeat (Wrath) fixed number in region
        -TODO
    -Type 2: Requires red (burning) laser to defeat, invincible sitting around (Sloth)
        -TODO
    -Type 3: Invincible, no weapons, removes human buildings, requires remote deactivation (monolith behind terrain) (Envy)
        -TODO
    -Type 4: Constructs pylons (useless blocking structures), requires extractor upgrade to remove pylons (Gluttony)
        -Prevent monument placer from getting stuck
    -Type 5: Pollutes tiles with loads from factory (emptying out waste stockpile) (Greed)
        -TODO
    -Type 6: (Lust)
        -TODO
    -Type 7: (Zone containing the City and the Tower, activated when all other zones are complete) 
             Causes humans to summon the Mammon Machine which will offer them eternal life, eternal sleep. If they accept, you are deleted. 
             They will reject it if you have made proper choices. (Pride)
        -TODO

2. Finish objective chains & triggers ^
    Technologies:
        -Jets, Pylon Demolition (Processor Upgrade), Red Laser, Blue Laser 
6. Village growth activates ruins: Labs increase civ level, factories create drone attack waves (can make them red again)
1. Final objective: disassemble all structures and drones in all regions, leaving only nature behind.


11. Apply tech research to existing units not just new ones
1. Implement ord regeneration ability
16. inactive factories are guarded by fixed groups of creatures
15. villages and caves sometimes produce enemy creatures (creature probability table is tile based)
11. If swarm leader is selected, draw lines to swarm members?
