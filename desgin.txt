beasts and machines from the old empire prowl the wastes

build a network of point to point charging stations to keep the bots moving

1. the pod (planetary ordinance disposal) system lands
2. 2 basic designs are avilable. send out the scouts and wallE compactors
3. more components are unlocked when certain resources are discovered, or data caches are found
4. baddies show up when disturbed
5. mission is complete when the map has been cleaned
15. Selected bot can be used to 'rally' other bots to it and create a swarm
16. Rally depends on bot type:
    -Processing drones: rallies drones with extractor abilities
    -Defense drones: rallies other defense drones
    -Scout drones: not available


11. Mark swarm leaders
16. inactive factories are guarded by fixed groups of creatures
15. inactive factories occasionally create war machines until converted
15. villages and caves sometimes produce enemy creatures
16. Factories can only build certain drone types
10. Bots will only pick up material they have a valid dropoff point for
12. Processing drone types : Heavy metal, Petrochemicals, Plastics
11. Having materials will unlock a new bot design
