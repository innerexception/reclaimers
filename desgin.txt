Reclaim the wasteland - robot factorio

Build bots from your inventory of parts

send them out to cleanse the wasteland and return valuable materials they extract

beasts and machines from the old empire prowl the wastes

build a network of point to point charging stations to keep the bots moving

1. the pod (planetary ordinance disposal) system lands
2. 2 basic designs are avilable. send out the scouts and wallE compactors
3. more components are unlocked when certain resources are discovered, or data caches are found
4. baddies show up when disturbed
5. mission is complete when the map has been cleaned



10. Production timer for bot factories. Choose bot production to reset the timer.
11. Base/charging stations vs factories. Factories pre-positioned? Requires materials to activate?
12. Processing plants (drop off sites): Heavy metal, Petrochemicals, Plastics
13. Bots must find a path to a valid drop off site. This may require multiple charging stations along route. 
    (Bots should attempt to follow move orders until there is no charging station to proceed forward with)


11. Use material to design and build a new bot (or unlock a new design?)
13. Extractors shouldn't attempt to work the same squares
