send them out to cleanse the wasteland and return valuable materials they extract

beasts and machines from the old empire prowl the wastes

build a network of point to point charging stations to keep the bots moving

1. the pod (planetary ordinance disposal) system lands
2. 2 basic designs are avilable. send out the scouts and wallE compactors
3. more components are unlocked when certain resources are discovered, or data caches are found
4. baddies show up when disturbed
5. mission is complete when the map has been cleaned
15. Selected bot can be used to 'rally' other bots to it and create a swarm
16. Rally depends on bot type:
    -Processing drones: rallies drones with extractor abilities
    -Defense drones: rallies other defense drones
    -Scout drones: not available

2. Labs are used to unlock drone improvements such as new toxins for your purifiers

1. Flesh out tutorial map events and polish mission
19. Objectives are global and can require changing levels to complete
16. inactive factories are guarded by fixed groups of creatures
15. villages and caves sometimes produce enemy creatures (creature probability table is tile based)
11. If swarm leader is selected, draw lines to swarm members?
