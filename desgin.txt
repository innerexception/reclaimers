Reclaim the wasteland - robot factorio

Build bots from your inventory of parts

send them out to cleanse the wasteland and return valuable materials they extract

beasts and machines from the old empire prowl the wastes

build a network of point to point charging stations to keep the bots moving

1. the pod (planetary ordinance disposal) system lands
2. 2 basic designs are avilable. send out the scouts and wallE compactors
3. more components are unlocked when certain resources are discovered, or data caches are found
4. baddies show up when disturbed
5. mission is complete when the map has been cleaned
15. Selected bot can be used to 'rally' other bots to it and create a swarm
16. Rally depends on bot type:
    -Processing drones: rallies drones with extractor abilities
    -Defense drones: rallies other defense drones
    -Scout drones: not available

7. 7 regions with 7 drone types (each region has a signature type plus 1 or more other types of drone). 
   Convert the factories to stop the drone/monster waves.
   The solution to each Type of drone is found in a Lab somewhere in the world.
   Each type has a different effect on the humans the region, described in the intro text of the region.
    -Type 1: Requires blue (pacifier) laser to defeat (Wrath)
    -Type 2: Requires red (burning) laser to defeat, invincible sitting around (Sloth)
    -Type 3: Invincible, no weapons, removes humans, requires remote deactivation (monolith behind terrain) (Envy)
    -Type 4: Constructs pylons (useless blocking structures), requires extractor upgrade to remove pylons (Gluttony)
    -Type 5: Pollutes tiles with loads from factory (emptying out waste stockpile) (Greed)
    -Type 6: (Lust)
    -Type 7: (Zone containing the City and the Tower) Causes humans to summon the Mammon Machine which will offer them eternal life. If they accept, you are deleted. They will reject it if you have made proper choices. (Pride)
6. Village growth activates ruins: Labs increase civ level, factories create drone attack waves (can make them red again)

2. Finish objective chains & triggers
1. Final objective: disassemble all structures and drones in all regions, leaving only nature behind.


11. Apply tech research to existing units not just new ones
12. Generate human villages over time (If wake the all-makers is chosen)
3. Design more region maps tied to objective chains
1. Implement ord regeneration ability

16. inactive factories are guarded by fixed groups of creatures
15. villages and caves sometimes produce enemy creatures (creature probability table is tile based)
11. If swarm leader is selected, draw lines to swarm members?
